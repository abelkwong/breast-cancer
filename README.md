# Breast Cancer Prediction
This project uses a logistic regression algorithm to predict breast cancer using the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Start Jupyter Notebook by running the following command in your terminal:
```
jupyter notebook
```
4. Open the `breast cancer prediction.ipynb` file in your browser and run the code.

## Usage
The Jupyter Notebook contains step-by-step instructions on how to preprocess the data, train and test the logistic regression model, and evaluate the model's performance.
